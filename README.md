Whether to duel friends or see what your best score is in a certain amount of time!

2) Download the NeonsOnSpeed.dll provided above.

HOW TO USE THE MOD (this is important):

=================

"Enter Competition Mode" - Use this setting BEFORE ENTERING A STAGE, this will prevent you from leaving the stage and will display a timer that will count down.

"Timer Length" - Pretty self-explainatory, set the amount of time (in seconds) before entering competition mode and it will start counting down once you activate Competition Mode. (for the tournament, you can use 600 seconds for 10 mins and 900 seconds for 15 mins)

"Opponent Session ID" - This feature currently does nothing.

=================

Enjoy!
